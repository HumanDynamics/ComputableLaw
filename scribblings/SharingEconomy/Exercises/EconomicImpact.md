## Excercise Type: Input Structured Data

Individual participant inputs of variable data (ie through form, slider, etc) to seed a dynamics model.
 
# Topic: Economic Model Based Analysis 

Predictive Impact on economy "if" certain factors come to pass.  Impact on such economic measures as: 
* Liesure time
* Size of econ
* Investment

## UX Concept: 
Most math won't be shown but will exist as Python in exercise directory.  User will see effect of inputs to model (like SimCity).  

## Notes:

Variables that participants (eg students or workshop members) input would be things like: 

Input how much you think the sharing econ will increase the cost of transport w/r/t labor.  

- That spits out a total expectation of labor needs (just that market).  If it will eliminate labor then slide slider to zero.  (self driving cars for ex)

- Then SHOW if this happens, this is the total expected economic effect!
(This will start with existing full model of the economy "Cobb Douglas Production Function" COBB-Douglas, using that to predict impact/outcome on labor share of income and marginal value of labor.  AND FURTHER use that to predict effect on liesure.  Then you have sum of impact on productivity, etc)
